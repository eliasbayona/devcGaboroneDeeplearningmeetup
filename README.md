## Fundametals
- Input output pipline
    What kind of data show the network expect and the expected output?
    eg 34x34 gray scale images -> class(probability) output
    
- data normalization
- batchnorm 2d, 1d, 3d 

- Types of neural networks
	* Basic deep neural network
	* CNN, DCNN
	* GAN, DCGAN
	* AUTO ENCODERS
	* many more...

- network architectures
	* VGG 
	* RESNET 
	* FAST RNN, FASTER RNN
	* INCEPTION
	
- Forward and Backward propagation 

How do i know if the model is training (learning something)
	- loss functions
      * REGRESSION
        - Mean Square Error
        - Mean Absolute Error
      * Classification Losses
	  - Log Loss, Negative Log Likelihood
	  - CATEGORICAL CROSS ENTROPHY LOSS
			

- Activation functions [missinglink.ai](https://missinglink.ai/guides/neural-network-concepts/7-types-neural-network-activation-functions-right/)
> Activation functions are mathematical equations that determine the output of a neural network. The function is attached to each neuron in the network, and determines whether it should be activated (“fired”) or not, based on whether each neuron’s input is relevant for the model’s prediction. Activation functions also help normalize the output of each neuron to a range between 1 and 0 or between -1 and 1.

	* RELU
	* TanH
	* Sigmoid
	* Leaky ReLU
	* Softmax

- learning rate

- overfitting vs underfitting

- momentum

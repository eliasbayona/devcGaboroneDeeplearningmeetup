## Fundametals
- Input output pipline
    What kind of data show the network expect and the expected output?
    eg 34x34 gray scale images -> class(probability) output
    
- data normalization
- batchnorm 2d, 1d, 3d 

- Types of neural networks
	* Basic deep neural network
	* CNN, DCNN
	* GAN, DCGAN
	* AUTO ENCODERS
	* many more...

- network architectures
	* VGG 
	* RESNET 
	* FAST RNN, FASTER RNN
	* INCEPTION

How do i know if the model is training (learning something)
	- loss functions
      * REGRESSION
        - Mean Square Error
        - Mean Absolute Error
      * Classification Losses
	  - Log Loss, Negative Log Likelihood
	  - CATEGORICAL CROSS ENTROPHY LOSS
			

- Activation functions
	* RELU
	* TanH
	* Sigmoid
	* Leaky ReLU
	* Softmax

- learning rate

- overfitting vs underfitting

- momentum
	
## PROJECTS

- Style transfer
